We review studies of the intergalctic medium (IGM) via 
\HI\ absorption with emphasis on the decades of previous
research with quasar absorption line studies.
The chapter begins with a historical perspective
and then offers a pedagogical description of the 
quantum mechanics underlying the Lyman series and 
Lyman continuum opacity of the \HI\ atom.
We describe the manifestation of these opacities in 
absorption spectroscopy and the challenges related to
normalization of quasar emission.  Standard measurement
techniques (equivalent width, line-profile fitting) are
introduced.  We then introduce the \nhi\ frequency distribution
\fnhi\ and efforts to constrain this distribution across
cosmic time with emphasis on the optically thin \lya\ forest.   
A discussion of optically gas (Lyman limit systems and
damped \lya\ systems) and its relation to the mean free path
is presented.
Online presentations and Python notebooks supplement
this chapter with examples, a review of modern work, and 
thoughts on future progress.
