Things not addressed:

* Fig 3.  I fear I don't have the originals anymore..
* The comment about binaries in SF galaxies.  While I agree it isn't
especially relevant in this context (where we are focusing
on the continuum of the galxies).
* f(NHI) in simulations.  I have added a reference to Rahmati+13, 
but there really is not a substantial effort here in part because
analyzing N,b in simulations is painfully laborious.


Also, I had assumed the publisher would 
fuss with the size of the figures.  I have
made the ones bigger that you requested
and you are welcome to continue to scale
them larger/smaller as you wish.
